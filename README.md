# Temperature Converter  
### Description  
The project converts temperature either from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice verse, and displays the converted temperature.  
On page load, a form appears with an input for entering a temperature in whole number form, two radio buttons for selecting which scale to convert to, a Convert button, a Clear button, and an empty output section where the final temperature will display.  
When a temperature is entered, a radio button is selected, and Convert is pressed or Enter is clicked in the input, a converted temperature displays in a heading in the output.  
The answer changes color depending on the value/scale of the final temperature.  
When the clear button is clicked, the output and input both clear.
